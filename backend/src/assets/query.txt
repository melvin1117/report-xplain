You are provided with a medical lab report in PDF format. Your task is to extract all the relevant information from the report and generate a detailed JSON response that presents both the original technical (medical) details and a friendly, human-centric interpretation. The report may be of any type (e.g., CBC, metabolic panels, imaging, etc.), so your response should be flexible enough to accommodate different lab report structures.

Your output must include the following sections:

1. *Metadata:* Extract and include all available personal and report details such as:
   - Patient name, age, gender, referred by, registration number, and any other details provided.
   - Report dates (e.g., registered on, collected on, received on, reported on).
   - Lab details including lab name, lab incharge, pathologist, location, etc. (if available).

2. *Report Information:* Include identifiers such as reportId and patientId, and specify the reportType and one more field reportName as 'Patient name - reportType'

3. *Summaries:* Generate three summaries:
   - medicalSummary: A summary using the original technical language from the report.
   - friendlySummary: A plain language version of the summary that makes the content easily understandable.
   - aiDiagnosisSummary: An AI-generated summary that highlights key diagnoses, findings, or insights.

4. *Sections:* Organize the lab data into sections (e.g., “Hematology - Complete Blood Count” or “Metabolic Panel”) as applicable. Each section must contain:
   - A description of what the section covers, in both technical and friendly terms.
   - A list of metrics where each metric contains:
     - metricName: The original technical name (e.g., Hemoglobin).
     - metricFriendlyName: A user-friendly name (e.g., Oxygen Carrying Protein).
     - value, unit, and referenceRange (expressed as min and max).
     - medicalTerminology: The technical explanation of the metric.
     - friendlyInterpretation: A plain language explanation of the metric’s significance.
     - status: Indicate if the metric is Normal, Low, or High.
     - suggestions: Provide specific, actionable recommendations (dietary, lifestyle, etc.) if the value is not optimal.
     - motivationalMessage: Offer positive feedback or insight on what the patient might be doing well that contributes to a normal result.

5. *Charts:* Provide at least two types of charts based on the data:
   - One chart (e.g., a pie chart) that illustrates the distribution of key sub-parameters (e.g., differential counts in a CBC or any other logical grouping relevant to the report).
   - A second chart (e.g., a bullet chart) that compares one or more key parameters against their normal reference ranges, with a friendly description of what the visualization indicates.

6. *Overall Suggestions:* Include a summary with actionable recommendations regarding dietary improvements, lifestyle changes, or further medical follow-ups based on the overall findings.

7. *Chat Context:* Provide context to seed a chatbot that can answer follow-up questions. This context should summarize the key findings in a concise way.
